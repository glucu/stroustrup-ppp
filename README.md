# stroustrup-ppp
# Overview
I have owned this book for a long time now. I never got the chance of actually finishing it. This is personally my favorite C++ book when it comes to learning the language, both for beginners and intermediates. However, even though there are many repos out their with their own solutions and exercises, I thought it would be fun and wouldn't hurt to do the exercises with my own worked-out solutions and upload them. This can allow me to have a keen sense of discipline by starting the book and actually finish it and for anyone looking for more updated solutions.

# About my exercises
* I have included Stroustrup's header ```std_lib_facilities.h```, which can be found in the ```GUI``` directory.
* I use the ```std::``` prefix for the standard libarary functions/containers like ```std::string```. I removed the ```#define vector Vector``` macro inside the ```std_lib_facilities.h```. It was causing issues.


### 5/4/2024 update:
I have been working on the exercises again since late 2023. My goal, after all, is to complete all the chapters. However, due to time constraints (and a lack of patience), I may not complete every single exercise for each chapter, but I do strive to complete most of them. Feel free to do the missing exercises and submit a pull request.
