# stroustrup-ppp
# Overview
I have owned this book for a long time now. I never got the chance of actually finishing it. This is personally my favorite C++ book when it comes to learning the language, both for beginners and intermediates. However, even though there are many repos out their with their own solutions and exercises, I thought it would be fun and wouldn't hurt to do the exercises with my own worked-out solutions and upload them. This can allow me to have a keen sense of discipline by starting the book and actually finish it and for anyone looking for more updated solutions.

# About my exercises
* I have included stroustrups header ```std_lib_facilities.h``` that can be found in the ```include``` directory. 
* I use the ```std::``` namespace for the standard libarary functions like ```std::string``` by also removing the ```#define vector Vector``` Macro inside of the header file.
