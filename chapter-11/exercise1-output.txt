the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush 
of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize 
genetic engineering. this enterprise has proceeded so rapidly-with so little 
outside commentary-that its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at 
all. biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. by 
the end of this decade, it will have outdistanced atomic 
power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives. 
in the words of one observer, "biotechnology is going to 
transform every aspect of human life: our medical care, our 
food, our health, our entertainment, our very bodies. nothing will 
ever be the same again. it's literally going to change 
the face of the planet."
