The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush ofastonishing proportions:
the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. This enterprise has 
proceeded so rapidly-with so little outside commentary-that its dimensions and implications 
are hardly understood at all. Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. 
By the end of this decade, it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on 
our everyday lives. In the words of one observer, "Biotechnology is going to transform every 
aspect of human life: our medical care, our food, our health, our entertainment, our verybodies. 
Nothing will ever be the same again. It's literally going to change the face of the planet."
