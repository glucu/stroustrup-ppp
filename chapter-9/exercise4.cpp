/* COMMENT:
 * Wow...just trying to indent properly honestly got my brain hurting.
 * This is a struct, and structs should just contain data, and have no invariants.
 * However, this code example is obscure and meaningless. It should be disposed of.
 * Yet I decided to organize it so it can at least be representable.
