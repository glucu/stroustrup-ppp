From now on, I will begin to include the header files that are needed for the exercises via the <b>#include</b>
preprocessor directives. The facilities in the std namespace will also be prefixed with the <b>std::</b>. This is to 
assure that its clear what facilities I am using and to prevent naming polutions.
