"reptiles are abhorrent because of their cold body, pale color, cartilaginous skeleton, filthy skin, fierce aspect, calculating eye, offensive smell, harsh voice, squalid habitation, and terrible venom; wherefore their creator has not exerted his powers to make many of them." 

linnaeus  1797

introduction 

"the ingen incident" 

the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering  this enterprise has proceeded so rapidly-with so little outside commentary-that its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all  

biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history  by the end of this decade  it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives  in the words of one observer  "biotechnology is going to transform every aspect of human life: our medical care, our food, our health, our entertainment, our very bodies. nothing will ever be the same again. it's literally going to change the face of the planet." 

but the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects from past scientific transformations  

first  it is broad-based. america entered the atomic age through the work of a single research institution  at los alamos  it entered the computer age through the efforts of about a dozen companies  but biotecbnology research is now carried out in more than two thousand laboratories in america alone  five hundred corporations spend five billion dollars a year on this technology  

second  much of the research is thoughtless or frivolous  efforts to engineer paler trout for better visibility in the stream  square trees for easier lumbering  and injectable scent cells so you ll always smell of your favorite perfume may seem like a joke  but they are not  indeed  the fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion  such as cosmetics and leisure activities  heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology  

third  the work is uncontrolled  no one supervises it  no federal laws regulate it  there is no coherent government policy  in america or anywhere else in the world  and because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to artificial snow  an intelligent policy is difficult  

but most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists themselves  it is remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the commerce of biotechnology  there are no detached observers  everybody has a stake  

the commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning ethical event in the history of science  and it has happened with astonishing speed  for four hundred years since galileo  science has always proceeded as a free and open inquiry into the workings of nature  scientists have always ignored national boundaries  holding themselves above the transitory concerns of politics and even wars  scientists have always rebelled against secrecy in research  and have even frowned on the idea of patenting their discoveries  seeing themselves as working to the benefit of all mankind  and for many generations  the discoveries of scientists did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality  

when  in 1953  two young researchers in england  james watson and francis crick  deciphered the structure of dna  their work was bailed as a triumph of the human spirit  of the centuries-old quest to understand the universe in a scientific way  it was confidently expected that their discovery would be selflessly extended to the greater benefit of mankind  

yet that did not happen  thirty years later  nearly all of watson and crick s scientific colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterprise entirely  research in molecular genetics had become a vast  multibillion dollar commercial undertaking  and its origins can be traced not to 1953 but to april 1976  

that was the date of a now famous meeting  in which robert swanson  a venture capitalist  approached herbert boyer  a biochemist at the university of california  the two men agreed to found a commercial company to exploit boyer s gene-splicing techniques  their new company  genentech  quickly became the largest and most successful of the genetic engineering start-ups. 

suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich  new companies were announced almost weekly  and scientists flocked to exploit genetic research  by 1986  at least 362 scientists  including 64 in the national academy  sat on the advisory boards of biotech firms  the number of those who held equity positions or consultancies was several times greater  

it is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude actually was  in the past  pure scientists took a snobbish view of business  they saw the pursuit of money as intellectually uninteresting  suited only to shopkeepers  and to do research for industry  even at the prestigious bell or ibm labs  was only for those who couldn t get a university appointment  thus the attitude of pure scientists was fundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists  and to industry in general  their long-standing antagonism kept university scientists free of contaminating industry ties  and whenever debate arose about technological matters  disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest levels  

but that is no longer true  there are very few molecular biologists and very few research institutions without commercial affiliations  the old days are gone  genetic research continues  at a more furious pace than ever  but it is done in secret  and in haste  and for profit  

in this commercial climate  it is probably inevitable that a company as ambitious as international genetic technologies  inc   of palo alto  would arise  it is equally unsurprising that the genetic crisis it created should go unreported  after all  ingen s research was conducted in secret  the actual incident occurred in the most remote region of central america  and fewer than twenty people were there to witness it  of those  only a handful survived  

even at the end  when international genetic technologies filed for chapter 11 protection in san francisco superior court on october 5  1989  the proceedings drew little press attention  it appeared so ordinary: ingen was the third small american bioengineering company to fail that year  and the seventh since 1986  few court documents were made public  since the creditors were japanese investment consortia  such as hamaguri and densaka  companies which traditionally shun publicity  to avoid unnecessary disclosure  daniel ross  of cowan  swain and ross  counsel for ingen  also represented the japanese investors  and the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of costa rica was heard behind closed doors  thus it is not surprising that  within a month  the problems of ingen were quietly and amicably settled  

parties to that settlement  including the distinguished scientific board of advisers  signed a nondisclosure agreement  and none will speak about what happened-but many of the principal figures in the "ingen incident" are not signatories  and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those final two days in august 1989 on a remote island off the west coast of costa rica
