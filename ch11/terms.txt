binary: base-2 number system in which data is represented with only two symbols (0 and 1) in which each bit in a sequence of bits has a place-value of powers of 2

character classification: a way to categorize what a character is: is it a digit? a letter? whitespace? using the standard library functions like isupper(), isdigit() etc

decimal: base-10 number system where a digit is represented with one of 10 symbols [0-9]. Each digit in a number has a place-value of powers of 10

defaultfloat: floating-point format that outputs the number in either fixed or scientific form to give the numerically most accurate representation,
              with the precision of the defaultfloat (6 precision).

file positioning: select a specific place in a file for reading or writing by altering the read or write position within the file.
                  Usually done using the seekg() and seekp() functions of the istream and ostream respectfully.

fixed: floating-point format that prints the number of precision after the decimal point (defaults to 6 precision after the decimal point).

hexadecimal: base-16 number system that uses 16 symbols [0-9, A-F] that represents data. Each place-value of a hex symbol is a power of 16. Mostly used
             when reading memory addresses. This is so because each hex symbol can represent 4-bits (a nibble), so two hex symbols can be used to represent 1 byte.

line-oriented input: Line-oriented input in C++ involves reading input from the standard input stream on a per-line basis using the getline() function,
                     allowing for the processing of entire lines, which can be useful when dealing with sentences, commands, or scenarios where preserving the entire line structure is important.

manipulator: To change the behavior of a stream

nonstandard separator: separators that are not standard for an istream by default. These separators encompass any characters other than whitespace and are used to separate words or tokens during input operations.

noshowbase: manipulator that reverses the action of showbase that does not use the prefixes for (set by default).

octal: base-8 number system that represents data using the 8 symbols [0-7]. Each digit's position represents a power of 8. Octal is less commonly used today compared
       to decimal (base-10) and hexadecimal (base-16), but it is   still occasionally encountered in computing contexts. In programming,
       octal literals are often denoted by a leading '0' (e.g., 075), and in some programming languages, such as C and C++, a leading '0' indicates an octal constant.

output formatting: As programmers, we aim at making our output as clear and as close as possible to the expectations of the “consumers” of our program.

scientific: use mantissa and exponent notation; the mantissa is always in the [1-10) range; there is a single nonzero digit before the decimal point.

setprecision(): Allows a programmer to set the precision using the manipulator setprecision().

showbase: manipulator that adds the prefix 0 for octal and 0x for hexadecimal.
