 * Output:
 *
 * pi == 0x5556f92b0eb0
 * pd == 0x5556f92b0ed0
 *
 * The output format is in hexadecimal notation (base-16 system)
 * On a 64 bit architecture, all of the memory addresses are 64 bits (each hex digit is four bits, so thatâ€™s 16 hex digits). The leading zeros are dropped.
 * On a typical 32-bit architecture, there would only be 32 bits in a pointer, so only 8 hex digits. As a result, such an architecture can only use up to 4 GiB of RAM.
