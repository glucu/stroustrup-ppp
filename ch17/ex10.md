Look at your solution of exercise 7. Is there any way that input could get the array to overflow; that is, is there any way
you could enter more characters than you allocated space for (a serious error)? Does anything reasonable happen if you
try to enter more characters than you allocated?

The program does not overflow if the user tries to enter more characters then what is allocated on the heap. This is so because
the program asks for <b>n</b> and the proceeding for-loop enforces the condition: <b>i != n && ci.get(ch) && ch != '!'</b>
Now if, the user does enter more characters then the size of n, then the for-loop will only read from the first character, 
up to and including n - 1. Any remaining characters are left in the input buffer. Because the program will go out of scope,
that is obviously freed. But assuming the program needs to do more work (calling other functions etc) that may need to use
cin again, then its best to make sure you clear the istream buffer, that way the characters left in the input buffer do not
write the objects that was not intended.
