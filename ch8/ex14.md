***Exercise 14***

1. Can we declare a non-reference function argument const (e.g., void f(const int);)? What might that mean? 
   Why might we want to do that? Why donâ€™t people do that often? Try it; write a couple of small programs to see what works.

Yes, you can legally declare a non-reference function argument const, but it is not necessary. It tells the function to not modify 
the parameter, and the function promises not to do so. There is no reason to do such a thing because when you pass an argument to a function as a non-reference, you are making
a COPY of that argument's value, modifying the copied parameter only changes the state of the parameter and not the original. That is probably
why most people do not do it often.
