# Exercise 10
> Look at your solution of exercise 7. Is there any way that input could get
  the array to overflow; that is, is there any way you could enter more
  characters than you allocated space for (a serious error)? Does anything
  reasonable happen if you try to enter more characters than you allocated?
  
  If you are not careful, you can enter more characters and go past the size of the array.
  Working at this low-level does not give you enough system support.
